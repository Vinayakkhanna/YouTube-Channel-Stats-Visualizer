## 💡 How It Works

1. The user uploads a **CSV file** containing monthly YouTube statistics.  
2. The system loads the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame for analysis.  
3. The user selects a **metric** (Views, Likes, or Watch Hours) from a dropdown menu.  
4. A **graph type** (Line, Bar, or Seaborn Style) is chosen for visualization.  
5. The system plots the selected metric and displays **summary statistics** below the graph.  

### 🧾 Example Dataset
```csv
Month,Views,Likes,Watch_Hours
Jan,1200,300,40
Feb,2500,700,80
Mar,1800,500,60
Apr,3000,900,100
May,3500,1200,120
Jun,4000,1500,140
